          <li>
            John Melchior Bosco, popularly known as Don Bosco, was an Italian
            Catholic priest, educator, writer and saint of the 19th century.
          </li>
          <li>
            John Bosco was born on the evening of 16 August 1815 in the hillside
            hamlet of Becchi, Italy. Becchi is located in a region that was
            called Castelnuovo d'Asti, which was later renamed Castelnuovo Don
            Bosco in honour of the saint.
          </li>
          <li>
            He was the youngest son of Francesco Bosco (1784–1817) and
            Margherita Occhiena. He had two older brothers, Antonio, and
            Giuseppe (1813–1862). The Boscos of Becchi were farmhands of the
            Moglian Family. John Bosco was born in a time of great shortage and
            famine in the Piedmontese countryside,
          </li>
          <li>
            When he was little more than two years old, his father, Francesco
            died, which left the support of three boys to his mother,
            Margherita. She played a strong role in Bosco's formation and
            personality,[18] and was an early supporter of her son's ideals
          </li>

            The Salesians of Don Bosco (SDB), formally known as the Society of
            Saint Francis de Sales, is a religious congregation of men in the
            Catholic Church, founded in the late 19th century by Italian priest
            Saint John Bosco to help poor children during the Industrial
            Revolution. The congregation was named after Saint Francis de Sales,
            a 17th-century bishop of Geneva.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco, formally known as the Daughters
            of Mary Help of Christians are a female religious institute formed
            by Saint Maria Domenica Mazzarello in 1872. They were founded to
            work alongside Saint John Bosco and his Salesians of Don Bosco in
            his teaching projects in Turin.
